## Professional Experience

**Software Engineer** @ [Meta](https://meta.com/) _(Feb 2016 - Present)_ <br>
  - **Ads Serving Infra**: Current team. I helped realize multiple short-form video / real-time signal initiatives in the existing serving infra, with extreme constraints on computing resources. I act as POC in serving infra partnering with multiple ranking/product/ads teams.

  - **Integrity Actions Platform**

    - I built Meta's integrity decision platform from scratch, which aimed to support ongoing compliance challenges in decision, enforcement, and appeal spaces. Started literally from draft design and the first line of code, until it achieved more than 90% adoption across the integrity org when I left. Evolved the project scope from 1 Eng HC (myself) to multiple teams, cross-region virtual org with more than 20 Eng HC directly working on the core platform, and >100 people contributing to the area over 2 years.

    - To support the above challenges, I partnered with the rule engine team to evolve the existing UI-based rule engine to support multi-layer DAG and increase their reliability by 10x. With its help, fragmented logic across the codebases became feasible to migrate into config-based rules, making governance over compliance in the integrity space viable across Meta.

    - Team member of an established integrity action/enforcement platform, working on multiple projects.

  - **Pages Infra/Movie Ticketing/Events/Communities**

    - Team member of the page backend infra. Built Instant Workflow with 10 other engineers across different teams, which allows 3rd parties to port their business logic into Facebook Pages natively through a DSL, like a Mini App. To showcase the ability of the platform, I built a movie ticketing use case from scratch with [Fandango & Atom Tickets](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-launches-movie-ticketing-discounts-through-fandango-atom-tickets-1202731932/), allowing users to buy movie tickets on Facebook.

    - The use case later got acquired by the Events org, as part of [Event Ticketing](https://www.facebook.com/help/1769557403280350). After I built the end-to-end experience, including discovery and payments, I received support from the org leader to fund the [Movie Ticketing](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-book-movie-tickets-without-booking-fees-2018-7) team, growing it from 0.5 Eng HC (myself) with no PM/Design/DS, to a full standalone team with XFNs.

    - I acted as the uber tech lead for the movie ticketing & movie ads teams, building user and ads products. We grew the movie ads sector from 400M to 500M revenue/year by providing first-party experiences and ads attribution/audience products in multiple countries before the industry was affected by the pandemic.

    - One interesting project I built was to predict movie in-theater views for a general FB/IG user, with the help of location/movement signals + showtimes data.

## Professional Experience

**Software Engineer** @ [Meta](https://meta.com/) _(Feb 2016 - Present)_ <br>
  - **Ads Serving Infra**: Current team. I helped realize multiple ranking/product initiatives in the existing serving infra, e.g. short-form video / real-time signal, with extreme constraints on latency. I act as POC in serving infra partnering with multiple ranking/product/ads teams to support their team's effort into serving infra.

  - **Integrity Actions Platform**

    - I built Meta's integrity decision platform from scratch, which aimed to support ongoing compliance needs in decision, enforcement, and appeal areas. TL;DR: It unified logics in various integrity stages, out from fragmented code to configs executable by rule engine, so it can be geverened and regulated. I started the project literally from draft design and the first line of code, until it achieved more than 90% adoption across the integrity org when I left. I evolved the project scope from 1 Eng HC (myself) to multiple teams, cross-region virtual org with more than 20 Eng HC directly working on the core platform, and >100 people contributing to the area over 2 years.

    - Project Highlight: I partnered with the rule engine team to evolve the existing UI-based rule engine to support multi-layer DAG and increase their reliability by 10x. With its help, fragmented logic across the codebases became feasible to migrate into config-based rules, making governance over compliance in the integrity space viable across Meta.

    - Team member of an established integrity action/enforcement platform, working on multiple projects.

  - **Pages Infra/Movie Ticketing/Events/Communities**

    - Team member of the page backend infra. Built Instant Workflow with 10 other engineers across different teams, which allows 3rd parties to port their business logic into Facebook Pages natively through a DSL, like a Mini App. To showcase the ability of the platform, I built a movie ticketing use case from scratch with [Fandango & Atom Tickets](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-launches-movie-ticketing-discounts-through-fandango-atom-tickets-1202731932/), allowing users to buy movie tickets on Facebook.

    - The use case later got acquired by the Events org, as part of [Event Ticketing](https://www.facebook.com/help/1769557403280350). After I built the end-to-end experience, including discovery and payments, I received support from the org leader to fund the [Movie Ticketing](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-book-movie-tickets-without-booking-fees-2018-7) team, growing it from 0.5 Eng HC (myself) with no PM/Design/DS, to a full standalone team with XFNs.

    - I acted as the uber tech lead for the movie ticketing & movie ads teams, building various user and ads products. We grew the movie ads sector from 400M to 500M revenue/year by providing first-party experiences and ads attribution/audience products in multiple countries before the industry was affected by the pandemic.

    - Project Highlight: predict movie in-theater views for a general FB/IG user, with the help of location/movement signals + showtimes data.

  - **Intern: Ads Tracking**: Interned at Facebook from _(Jun 2015 - Aug 2015)_. I built infra & external API which supports auto creation of tracking ad/adset/campaign metadata directly from doubleclick(Google's Audience Network)'s traffic, without prior creation in GUI.

- Visiting scholar onsite at TCL Research America, via San Jose State University's Tower Foundation program.
- Worked on infra of a video content understanding platform extracting merchandise info from videos. My
job was rewrite CRUD GUI (from JSP to REST+mordern javascript), implement video pipelines do preprocessing like transcoding, clipping & invoking content understanding services owned by other teams. The system is served on AWS (EC2, S3, SQS, SWF, SNS).
<br><br>

**Software Engineer | Lead Executive Game Designer** @ [Kunlun (300418:CH)](http://www.kunlun.com/en/) _(Apr 2009 - Dec 2012)_ <br>
  - The Lead Designer position is more like a PM/SDM hybrid role which I took since 2011. We can chat more details in person if interested.
  - Before 2011, I worked as an SDE and was promoted up to tech lead of a game client team.
    - Developed online game clientsï¼šcore game play, animation lib, GUI components, network protocols and i18n frameworks.
    - Game Development Tooling implementation, including: IDE replaces Adobe Flash, map editor, script editor, data/assets packager, etc. 
    - As the lead of game client team, trained engineers from other background in action script and internal tooling.
